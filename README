1. GBS Builds
=============

 gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH]



2. Building for Ubuntu desktop
==============================

2.1. Minimum Requirements
------------------------

 - Ubuntu 14.04
 - Environment created using dali_env script in dali-core repository

2.2. Building the Repository
----------------------------

To build the repository enter the 'build/tizen' folder:

 cd dali-adaptor/build/tizen

Then run the following commands:

 autoreconf --install
 ./configure --prefix=$DESKTOP_PREFIX --enable-profile=UBUNTU --enable-gles=20
 make install -j8


2.3. Building and executing test cases
--------------------------------------

To build the test cases, enter the 'automated-tests' folder:

 cd dali-core/automated-tests

Then run the following commands:

 ./build.sh
 ./execute.sh

This will build and execute the test cases. By default, this will not
generate test case output, but give you a summary of passes and fails.
To get failing test case output displayed on the command line, instead
run

 ./execute.sh -r

To generate an xml file with the test case output, instead of running
the tests in parallel, you will need to run them serially:

 ./execute.sh -s

You will need an appropriate style sheet to view this xml.
