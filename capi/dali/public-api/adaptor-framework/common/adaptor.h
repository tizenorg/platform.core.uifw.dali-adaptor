/**
 * An Adaptor object can be used as an alternative to the Dali::Application class if finer grained
 * control is required.  This will allow the application writer to provide their own main loop and
 * other platform related features.
 *
 * The Adaptor class provides a means for initialising the resources required by the Dali::Core.
 *
 * When dealing with platform events, the application writer MUST ensure that Dali is called in a
 * thread-safe manner.
 *
 * As soon as the Adaptor class is created and started, the application writer can initialise their
 * Dali::Actor objects straight away or as required by the main loop they intend to use (there is no
 * need to wait for an initialise signal as per the Dali::Application class).
 *
 * The Adaptor does emit a Resize signal which informs the user when the surface is resized.
 * Tizen and Linux Adaptors should follow the example below:
 *
 * @code
 * void CreateProgram(DaliAdaptor& adaptor)
 * {
 *   // Create Dali components...
 *   // Can instantiate adaptor here instead, if required
 * }
 *
 * int main ()
 * {
 *   // Initialise platform
 *   MyPlatform.Init();
 *
 *   // Create an 800 by 1280 window positioned at (0,0).
 *   Dali::PositionSize positionSize(0, 0, 800, 1280);
 *   Dali::Window window = Dali::Window::New( positionSize, "My Application" );
 *
 *   // Create an adaptor which uses that window for rendering
 *   Dali::Adaptor adaptor = Dali::Adaptor::New( window );
 *   adaptor.Start();
 *
 *   CreateProgram(adaptor);
 *   // Or use this as a callback function depending on the platform initialisation sequence.
 *
 *   // Start Main Loop of your platform
 *   MyPlatform.StartMainLoop();
 *
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If required, you can also connect class member functions to a signal:
 *
 * @code
 * MyApplication application;
 * adaptor.ResizedSignal().Connect(&application, &MyApplication::Resize);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see RenderSurface
