/**
 * An Application class object should be created by every application
 * that wishes to use Dali.  It provides a means for initialising the
 * resources required by the Dali::Core.
 *
 * The Application class emits several signals which the user can
 * connect to.  The user should not create any Dali objects in the main
 * function and instead should connect to the Init signal of the
 * Application and create the Dali objects in the connected callback.
 *
 * Applications should follow the example below:
 *
 * @code
 * void CreateProgram(Application app)
 * {
 *   // Create Dali components...
 *   // Can instantiate here, if required
 * }
 *
 * int main (int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   Application app = Application::New(&argc, &argv);
 *   app.InitSignal().Connect(&CreateProgram);
 *   app.MainLoop();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If required, you can also connect class member functions to a signal:
 *
 * @code
 * MyApplication app;
 * app.ResumeSignal().Connect(&app, &MyApplication::Resume);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class accepts command line arguments as well. The following options are supported:
 *
 * @code
 *     --no-vsync       Disable VSync on Render
 *  -w|--width          Stage Width
 *  -h|--height         Stage Height
 *  -d|--dpi            Emulated DPI
 *     --help           Help
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the above options are found, they are stripped from argv, and argc is updated appropriately.
