/**
 * @brief A watch class object should be created by every watch application
 * that wishes to use Dali.
 *
 * It provides a means for initialising the resources required by the Dali::Core.
 * Like Application class, the WatchApplication class manages Tizen watch application life cycle.
 *
 * The WatchApplication class emits additional signals which are availalble only in the watch application
 * (TimeTick, AmbientTick, AmbientChanged)
 *
 * This feature is supported in wearable applications only.
 *
 * WatchApplication Applications should follow the example below:
 *
 * @code
 * class ExampleController: public ConnectionTracker
 * {
 * public:
 *   ExampleController( WatchApplication& application )
 *   : mApplication( application )
 *   {
 *     mApplication.InitSignal().Connect( this, &ExampleController::Create );
 *   }
 *
 *   void Create( Application& application )
 *   {
 *     // Create Dali components...
 *   }
 *  ...
 * private:
 *   WatchApplication&  mApplication;
 * };
 *
 * int DALI_EXPORT_API main (int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   WatchApplication app = WatchApplication::New(&argc, &argv);
 *   ExampleController example( app );
 *   app.MainLoop();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If required, you can also connect class member functions to a signal:
 *
 * @code
 * MyApplication app;
 * app.ResumeSignal().Connect(&app, &MyApplication::Resume);
 * @endcode
 *
 * When the above options are found, they are stripped from argv, and argc is updated appropriately.
