/**
 * @brief Test case for load cancellation.
 *
 * Load lots of images in batches, cancelling all in a batch after a small delay to
 * allow the first of a batch to be launched before cancellation starts.
 * Assert that all loads issued are either completed or cancelled.
 *
 * @note Many loads will succeed despite our cancellations due to the coarse
 * granularity of the waits we introduce after loading each batch. That is
 * expected.
